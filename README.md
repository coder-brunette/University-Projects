## University Projects

This repository includes all the projects that I did during my college and some individual projects that I completed after my bachelors. It consists of total 12 projects.

1. Webcam Motion Detector, Chhatrapati Shivaji Institute of Technology                January 2016 – March 2016
Independently built a webcam motion detector based on Python to track motion on live camera.

2. Face Detection using Deep Learning, CSIT					     July 2017- October 2017
Detection of an individual or multiple faces in a picture using deep learning models.

3. Weather prediction using LSTM and ARIMA models.		       January 2018 – February 2018

4. Text Analytics and classification using bi-directional LSTM.		          August 2018 – October 2018

5. Bottle Cap and label detection for quality management and control with FRCNN using Deep Learning.
